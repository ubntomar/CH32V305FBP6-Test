## Introduction
The CH32V305FBP6-Test example showcases how to read data from the ADC, transmit it via UART, and store it in the flash memory of the CH32V307 microcontroller. This can be useful for applications requiring data logging or persistent storage.

## Hardware Requirements
- CH32V307 development board
- USB to UART converter
- Power supply (3.3V or 5V)
- Connecting wires

## Software Requirements
- CH32V307 SDK
- Integrated Development Environment (IDE) supporting CH32V307
- Serial terminal software (e.g., PuTTY, Tera Term)

## Setup
1. Connect the CH32V307 development board to your computer using the USB to UART converter.
2. Ensure the power supply is properly connected to the development board.
3. Open the project in your preferred IDE.
4. Compile and upload the firmware to the CH32V307 development board.

## Usage
1. Open the serial terminal software and connect to the appropriate COM port with the following settings:
    - Baud rate: 115200
    - Data bits: 8
    - Parity: None
    - Stop bits: 1
2. Reset the development board.
3. Observe the ADC data being transmitted via UART and stored in the flash memory.
